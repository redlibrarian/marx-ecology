          <p>Proposal: Because Marxism offers a theory of (the end of)
          capitalism <em>and</em> social/political emancipation, it is able to
          connect anti-capitalist and other interlinked social-justice
          struggles with ecology.</p>

        <section style="text-align:left">
          <p>Stronger proposal: Marxism is uniquely able to do this
          because it sees the cause of both climate change <em>and</em>
          oppression not in the activity of humanity itself, but in the
          workings of capitalism.</p>

          <ul style="font-size:24pt"><li>A theory of human equality and freedom</li>
            <li>A materialism</li>
            <li>Based on the idea that how we relate to the world -
              mainly through work - determines how we think and
              live</li>
            <li>Sees social and historical change as mainly driven

              have no access to raw materials</li>
            <li>This economic structure leads to a particular class

              the natural world</li>

            Beginning in the 1840s down to the present day, the concept
            of metabolism has been used as a key category in the systems
            theory approach to the interactions of organisms to their
            environments. It captures the complex biochemical processes
            of metabolic exchange, through which an organism (or a given
            cell) draws upon materials and energy from its enviroment
            and converts these by way of various metabolic reactions
            into the building blocks of growth. In addition, the concept
            of metabolism is used to refer to the specific
            <em>regulatory processes</em> that govern this complex
            interchange between organisms and their enviroment. (Foster,
